#   uid-1000 `agent` (see useradd below — UNCHANGED, agent stays
#   uid-1000; start.sh still `exec gosu agent`) has a wired, audited
#   path to host root inside the provisioner's `--privileged
#   --pid=host -v /:/host -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`
#   container. Without sudo, a uid-1000 process in --privileged CANNOT

#   uid-1000) and cannot use the root:docker 0660 docker.sock — T4
#   would be provisioner-shape-only (the documented ABSENT-escalation

#   2026-05-06 ECR-mirror rollback that PREDATES all T4 work and ships
#   NO leg). The sudoers drop-in + docker-group add are below, after
#   useradd, so `agent` exists. This is ADDITIVE: it does NOT change
#   the agent uid and does NOT change token ownership. The codex MCP
#   list_peers-401 token-resolution class (RFC internal#456 §10) is
#   fixed atomically in the SAME image revision via codex_mcp_config.sh
#   + start.sh's `chown -R agent:agent /configs`.

# RUNTIME_VERSION arg matches hermes/openclaw conventions — when set

# discovery loads adapter.py and `CodexAdapter.name()` ("codex") is
# authoritative. The previous Dockerfile (inherited from the stale
# single-commit Gitea mirror) ALSO monkeypatched
# `molecule_runtime.preflight.SUPPORTED_RUNTIMES` via an unguarded
# `python3 -c ...add('codex')` + a brittle in-file `sed`. That worked
# against the 2026-05-04 runtime baked into the deployed image
# (sha256:877e0687) but the CURRENT published runtime no longer
# exposes that exact mutable-set literal, so the unguarded RUN exited
# 1 and FAILED THE BUILD (validate-runtime + t4-conformance, CI run
# 1). Root-cause fix: drop the brittle file-rewrite entirely (neither
# hermes nor claude-code patch preflight — adapter discovery is the
# real registration path) and keep only a defensive, idempotent,
# never-fail compatibility shim for any older runtime that still gates
# on a mutable SUPPORTED_RUNTIMES set. `|| true` so a runtime that has

# --- Install the OpenAI Codex CLI globally as root (binary lives in

# both root and the agent user).
#
# Pinned EXACTLY to 0.130.0 (not a `~`/`^` range). Rationale:
#   * 0.130.0 is the npm `latest` dist-tag — the current stable line
#     (0.131.x is alpha-only at the time of this change; we do not
#     ship a pre-release CLI in a prod runtime image).
#   * The previous `~0.57` pin PREDATES `codex login --device-auth` /
#     ChatGPT-subscription OAuth: it cannot consume the modern
#     `auth.json` shape ({auth_mode:"chatgpt", tokens:{id_token,
#     access_token,refresh_token,account_id}, last_refresh}) and
#     ignores `forced_login_method = "chatgpt"`. The subscription
#     OAuth credential we now materialize (see start.sh Mode C) is
#     only usable on a CLI that supports this format — 0.130.0 does.
#   * config.yaml's default model (`gpt-5.5`) and the May-2026 roster
#     were already live-verified against codex-cli 0.130.0
#     linux/amd64 (thread/start returned "model":"gpt-5.5").
#   * codex's app-server protocol is `experimental` and breaks across
#     minor versions, so we pin the EXACT patch release rather than a
#     range — a bump is a deliberate, reviewed, re-verified change.

# MiniMax provider config + molecule MCP block and (as root, before
# the gosu drop) makes /configs agent-owned so the runtime AND the MCP
# child resolve the same agent-owned .auth_token.
