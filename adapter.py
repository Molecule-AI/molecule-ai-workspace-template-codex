"""Codex CLI adapter — runs OpenAI Codex (`@openai/codex`) inside the workspace.

This template wraps OpenAI's Codex CLI as a Molecule workspace runtime.
The actual A2A bridge lives in ``executor.py`` — this file is just the
``BaseAdapter`` shell: name, display metadata, config schema, executor
factory, and an ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` reachability check at setup.

Architecture in one paragraph: each workspace session holds one
long-lived ``codex app-server`` child (spawned by ``executor.py`` on
first turn) plus one Codex thread. A2A messages become ``turn/start``
RPCs against that thread, giving us session continuity + queued
mid-turn handling. See
``docs/integrations/codex-app-server-adapter-design.md`` in
molecule-core for the full design.

We deliberately do NOT run a separate daemon here (unlike hermes,
where a long-running gateway listens on :8642 from container boot).
``codex app-server`` is a stdio child of the executor, not a network
service — fewer moving parts, no port to configure, no health endpoint
to wait on at start time.
