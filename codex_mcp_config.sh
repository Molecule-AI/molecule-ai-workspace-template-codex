# codex_mcp_config.sh — append the molecule A2A MCP server block to

# / get_workspace_info / check_task_status as MCP tools.
#
# This is the codex equivalent of how claude_sdk_executor.py wires
# `mcp_servers["a2a"]` into the claude-agent-sdk options for the
# claude-code template. Without it, every codex workspace boots blind
# to its peers and reports "list_peers not available" the first time
# the agent tries to coordinate. Tracks issue
# Molecule-AI/molecule-ai-workspace-template-codex#15.

# Schema reference (codex-rs rust-v0.57.0 docs/config.md, MCP section):

#   env_vars = ["EXTRA_FORWARD"] # additional env-passthrough names
#
# Codex's default env whitelist (codex-rs/rmcp-client/src/utils.rs)
# covers HOME / PATH / LANG / TERM / TMPDIR / etc. but NOT the molecule-
# specific runtime env (WORKSPACE_ID, PLATFORM_URL, MOLECULE_ORG_ID,
# CONFIGS_DIR). We resolve them at install time and write literal
# values into the env map so the MCP child process has them regardless
# of how codex spawns it.
#
# Composition with codex_minimax_config.sh: that script uses `cat >`
# (overwrite). This script uses `cat >>` (append) and MUST run AFTER
# the minimax script — install.sh + start.sh both invoke them in that
# order. Idempotent: re-running on an already-configured config.toml
# strips the previous [mcp_servers.molecule] block before re-appending,
# so reboots don't accumulate duplicate entries.

# "Authentication to platform failed" while the runtime itself is
# fully authed. This is the codex instance of the Hermes
# list_peers-401 / OpenClaw "MCP wired to the wrong thing" class

#
# Root cause of the pre-fix bug: this script hard-defaulted
# CONFIGS_DIR_VAL to "/configs" when CONFIGS_DIR was unset, then wrote
# that literal into [mcp_servers.molecule.env]. configs_dir.resolve()
# treats an explicit CONFIGS_DIR env as an UNCONDITIONAL override (no
# writability check — molecule_runtime/configs_dir.py resolution
# order, see molecule-core#2458), so the MCP child was pinned to
# /configs even when the runtime had (correctly) fallen back to
# $HOME/.molecule-workspace because /configs is root-owned + not
# agent-writable in a fresh container. Result: token file at
# ~/.molecule-workspace/.auth_token, MCP child looking at
# /configs/.auth_token (absent) → 401 → "No peers found".
#
# Fix: ask configs_dir.resolve() itself (the single resolution point
# the runtime uses) what directory it picks, and write THAT. Falls
# back to an explicit operator CONFIGS_DIR if set, then to a literal
# resolve() under the agent HOME so the value is always the one the
# runtime's heartbeat + platform_auth actually use.
