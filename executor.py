"""A2A → codex app-server bridge.

Holds one persistent `codex app-server` child + one thread per
workspace session, dispatches each A2A message as a `turn/start` RPC
against the existing thread.

Design rationale lives in
``docs/integrations/codex-app-server-adapter-design.md`` (in
molecule-core). The short version:

- Persistent child gives us session continuity (the agent's
  conversation history, tool state, and config persist across A2A
  turns) without serializing through disk.
- Per-thread serialization (``_turn_lock``) gives us safe, ordered
  handling of mid-turn arrivals — A2A peers see their messages
  processed in arrival order, matching OpenClaw's per-chat
  sequentializer behavior.
- Notification-driven response assembly: the executor accumulates
  ``agent_message_delta`` chunks and emits the final assembled text
  on ``turn/completed``. Streaming forward is a future upgrade once
  the molecule-runtime contract supports incremental events.

The riskiest module of this stack is ``app_server.AppServerProcess``
(the raw JSON-RPC client) — that has its own unit tests. This file
focuses on the protocol-level lifecycle: thread bootstrap, turn
dispatch, notification accumulation, error surface.

        Stacked bounds:

          A healthy turn emits ``codex/event/*`` notifications
          continuously; a wedged channel emits zero. If the activity
          counter does not advance for this long, we raise
          ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` instead of waiting the full
          ``_TURN_TIMEOUT``. This is the safety net for the 2026-05-18
          production wedge: the executor would otherwise hold the
          turn-lock for 10 minutes per stuck request, masking the
          real channel failure.

        - ``_TURN_TIMEOUT`` (600 s) — hard upper bound for total turn
          duration even if events keep arriving. Preserves the
          previous-generation bound for legitimately-long tool-use
          turns (test runs, etc.).

        The watchdog runs in 5 s ticks. Each tick:
          1. If the completion event is set, return.
          2. If the activity counter has not changed since the last
             tick AND the inactivity window has elapsed, raise
             TimeoutError.
          3. If the total elapsed time exceeds ``_TURN_TIMEOUT``, raise
