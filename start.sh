# --- Make /configs agent-owned (fleet contract) ---
# T4 atomic-co-sequencing contract (RFC internal#456 §10): the T4
# escalation leg (sudo NOPASSWD + docker group, baked in the
# Dockerfile) is ADDITIVE — the agent still runs uid-1000 (the
# `exec gosu agent` below is UNCHANGED). The token MUST stay
# agent-readable so the runtime AND the codex MCP child both resolve
# the SAME .auth_token; escalation must NOT regress the codex
# list_peers-401 token-resolution class.
#
# The /configs volume is created by Docker/the provisioner as root.
# molecule_runtime/configs_dir.py picks /configs only when it exists
# AND is agent-writable, else falls back to $HOME/.molecule-workspace.
# Without this chown, /configs is root-owned, the runtime falls back
# to ~/.molecule-workspace for .auth_token — but codex_mcp_config.sh
# (pre-fix) hard-pinned CONFIGS_DIR=/configs into the MCP env, so the
# MCP child looked at the empty root-owned /configs and every
# list_peers/delegate_task 401'd ("No peers found") while the runtime
# itself was fully authed. This chown makes /configs the single
# agent-owned resolution point for BOTH; codex_mcp_config.sh's
# resolve()-based CONFIGS_DIR is the belt-and-suspenders half so they
# can never diverge again. Mirrors claude-code entrypoint.sh (12dd604)
# + hermes start.sh (PR#24/#26) `chown -R agent:agent /configs`.
# Runs as root here (before any gosu), so it takes effect for the

# --- Mode C: headless ChatGPT/Codex-subscription auth (single-runner) ---
# Canonical credential: CODEX_AUTH_JSON. This is the CONTENTS of a
# codex `auth.json` (auth_mode:"chatgpt", OPENAI_API_KEY:null,
# tokens:{id_token,access_token,refresh_token,account_id},
# last_refresh) — the OpenClaw `openai-codex` provider's auth.order
# pattern (docs.openclaw.ai/providers/openai): prefer an injected
# subscription auth.json over a pay-as-you-go API key. The blob is
# stored in the self-hosted Infisical SSOT at secret path
# `/shared/codex-oauth`, key `CODEX_AUTH_JSON` (env=prod), and is
# injected into the workspace container as the CODEX_AUTH_JSON env
# var via the workspace Config-tab secret binding for EXACTLY ONE
# runner (the combined Reviewer+Researcher box on the CTO's
# ChatGPT/Codex subscription).
#
# CODEX_CHATGPT_AUTH_JSON is accepted as a DOCUMENTED backward-compat
# alias (the name shipped by template PR #5). CODEX_AUTH_JSON wins if
# both are set, so a Config-tab override can shadow a stale alias.
#
# Writing it to $CODEX_HOME/auth.json makes codex authenticate off the
# subscription instead of OPENAI_API_KEY. Codex's documented headless
# refresh (refresh-and-retry on 401, rewrites auth.json in place)
# handles token rotation; the persistent /home/agent volume keeps the
# refreshed file. We deliberately add NO refresh daemon — OpenAI's
# supported CI/CD pattern is "run codex and persist the updated
# auth.json", not a manual refresh endpoint (RFC §5).
#
# Inert when neither var is set: the OPENAI_API_KEY and MiniMax paths
# above are byte-unchanged and remain the DOCUMENTED FALLBACK. This is
# SINGLE-RUNNER only; there is intentionally no multi-workspace
# credential fanout (RFC §5, §8) — one auth.json per runner, never
# shared across concurrent jobs. The token is never echoed.

# `AuthManager::auth().await`. In our prod-Reviewer / prod-Researcher
# topology the workspace can be idle (or wedged in executor.py) for
# >8 days between turns, so `auth()` never fires and the access_token
# silently expires. The watchdog below polls every 6h (default) and
# refreshes proactively via the same OAuth endpoint the CLI uses
# (https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token, client_id baked from
# codex-rs/login/src/auth/manager.rs). Inert when no auth.json is
# present OR when auth_mode != chatgpt (the API-key / MiniMax paths
# don't have refresh tokens). The watchdog is started ONLY when an
# auth.json was actually materialized above — for plain OPENAI_API_KEY
# or MINIMAX_API_KEY workspaces it doesn't run.
#
# Started under gosu agent so it inherits the same uid as molecule-
# runtime and can read/write the same agent-owned auth.json. PID is
# the start.sh shell's child; when the container is stopped or
# restarted the watchdog exits with it (no orphan).
