# WIRE_API CONTRACT (codex CLI 0.130, baked by #219 — internal#513):
# codex CLI 0.130 REMOVED the `chat` WireApi variant entirely (the
# OpenAI Chat Completions wire was dropped fleet-wide in Feb 2026,
# https://github.com/openai/codex/discussions/7782). 0.130 hard-fails
# config.toml parsing with
#   `wire_api = "chat"` is no longer supported. set `wire_api = "responses"`
# at the line that holds it — BEFORE auth.json / OPENAI_API_KEY is even
# read. So `chat` is invalid UNCONDITIONALLY for every provider block
# under 0.130; it is no longer a per-provider choice. We therefore emit
# `wire_api = "responses"` (the only parse-valid value on this CLI).
#
# PROD IMPACT: the production codex agents (Reviewer/Researcher) run the
# ChatGPT/Codex *subscription* OAuth path (CODEX_AUTH_JSON → ~/.codex/
# auth.json, model gpt-5.5). That is the OpenAI provider, which natively
# requires the Responses API on 0.130 — so `responses` is exactly
# correct for the path prod actually uses.
#
# KNOWN MINIMAX LIMITATION (documented, out of scope for internal#513):
# MiniMax's token-plan endpoint (https://api.minimax.io/v1) is an
# OpenAI *Chat Completions*-compatible API; per MiniMax's own codex-cli
# docs it does NOT serve the OpenAI Responses API. With `chat` removed
# from the CLI there is no parse-valid wire that MiniMax natively
# accepts on 0.130 — the MiniMax token-plan route needs its own
# follow-up (a Responses→Chat translation shim, or MiniMax shipping
# Responses support). We still write `responses` here so the config
# PARSES (the alternative is a non-loadable config that bricks every
# boot, incl. the subscription path). This is acceptable because no
# prod agent uses the MiniMax leg today (subscription is `Preferred`
# per README; OPENAI_API_KEY is the documented fallback) — both of
# those are native Responses providers. Tracked: molecule-ai/internal#514
# ("codex MiniMax token-plan leg incompatible with CLI 0.130 Responses-API,
# deferred from #513") — the dedicated follow-up for the MiniMax-Responses
# gap; internal#513 remains this change's cutover-blocker.
#
# When MINIMAX_API_KEY is missing this is a no-op so OpenAI-direct
# users see no behavior change.
#
# SUBSCRIPTION TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER THE MINIMAX ALT (internal#513):
# When the ChatGPT/Codex subscription is injected (CODEX_AUTH_JSON or
# its CODEX_CHATGPT_AUTH_JSON backward-compat alias is set — the prod
# Reviewer/Researcher path, #219) this script MUST NOT write the
# minimax provider block, even if MINIMAX_API_KEY also happens to be
# present on the same workspace. Codex 0.130's built-in OpenAI
# provider IS the subscription provider: with auth.json
# (auth_mode:"chatgpt") and NO `model_provider` override in
# config.toml, codex routes to the OpenAI/Codex Responses backend
# natively (verified: a working device-logged codex-0.130 config.toml
# carries NO model_provider / model / base_url / wire_api block at
# all — the model is selected via thread/start, which the adapter
# passes as gpt-5.5 from config.yaml). If we instead emit the minimax
# block here, config.toml pins model_provider=minimax +
# base_url=https://api.minimax.io/v1 while start.sh's mode-C only
# appends auth keys (it does NOT rewrite the provider) — so codex
# authenticates off the subscription but POSTs to
# https://api.minimax.io/v1/responses, which MiniMax does not serve
# → "unexpected status 404 Not Found ... url:
# https://api.minimax.io/v1/responses" on EVERY turn. That is the
# exact live A2A blocker observed on prod-Reviewer
# (469b511b-5794-4847-9da0-ddc0a9e6bc24) and prod-Researcher
# (4dfbd391-b541-437d-852c-88d80c3ffadc). The PR#10 wire_api flip was
# necessary (config parses) but NOT sufficient (still wrong provider).
# The minimax leg's own Chat-vs-Responses incompatibility on CLI 0.130
# stays tracked separately as molecule-ai/internal#514 and is NOT
# regressed here — it just no longer shadows the prod subscription
# path. Skip is a true no-op (identical to the no-MINIMAX_API_KEY
# branch): config.toml is left without a provider override so codex
# uses its built-in subscription provider.
